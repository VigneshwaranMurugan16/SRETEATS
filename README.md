# SRETEATS

## Introduction

Welcome to my project, a proof of concept for a food ordering web application in our college's canteen. The application allows you to easily order your favorite food items, pay ahead of time, and pick them up at the canteen. This project served as a learning tool to hone my skills in the foundations of web development.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ExpressJS: A web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A source-oriented database program.

## Workings:

After you clone the github repository, run the following commands:
```
cd /path/to/folder/called/Backend-Server
npm start

cd /path/to/folder/called/application
npm start
```
Now, please navigate to the localhost in your broswer to view the web application.
